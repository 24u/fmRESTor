Leverage the FileMakerÂ® 17, 18 & 19 Data API with ease!
----

fmRESTor an object-based library developed to seamlessly interact with databases and custom apps hosted on a FileMaker Server via the new powerful FileMaker Data API from within a PHP or JavaScript code. Forget about learning FileMaker Data API in detail, just create a new object, passing it necessary parameters to connect to the database, and use our easy to understand methods to access or modify your data. fmRESTor will take care of authentication, exceptions, and even session preservation in order for your code to be a well-behaving client for the FileMaker Data API without you having to worry about these technical details.

We created fmRESTor for ourselves to make it easier and faster to interact with FileMaker databases from within custom web apps we create, without having to waste our valuable time on repeating writing the same patterns over and over again, hunting for unnecessary bugs, and to be able to produce clean, easy to read and easy to maintain code.

We at 24U believe that the whole FileMaker developers community will benefit from the FileMaker Platform not only having new powerful RESTful API, but also developers using the API nicely and efficiently, therefore we decided to make our library available as Open Source, under the GNU LGPLv3 license.

We will greatly appreciate your contributions, although we cannot provide free support for the library. You may, however, hire us to help you with your projects for money by purchasing our services at [https://www.24uSoftware.com/fmRESTor](https://www.24uSoftware.com/fmRESTor#buy) or by utilizing our custom development services, available at [https://www.24uSoftware.com/custom-apps](https://www.24uSoftware.com/custom-apps).
